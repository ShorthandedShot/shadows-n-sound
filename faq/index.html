        Your browser does not support this audio format.

      <div class="q">
        How does the converter work?
      </div>

      <div class="a">
        The <strong>SHADOWS >>> SOUND</strong> converter generates audio based off of visuals of shadows that are uploaded. The converter takes a shadow's outline and generates an audio file that is based on the found outline.
      </div>

      <div class="q">
        what file types are supported?
      </div>

      <div class="a">
        SHADOWS >>> SOUND supports .jpg, .png, .mp4, .mov, and .wmv file types. It is reccommended that users upload .jpg or .png files.
        <br><br>
        Only a single frame of a video file will be used to generate audio. This frame will be selected at random according by the SHADOWS >>> SOUND converter.
      </div>

      <div class="q">
        what kind of visuals should i upload?
      </div>

      <div class="a">
        Visuals that are uploaded should include clear, defined shadows that have a visible outline. The shadows can be anything, and there are no limitations.
        <br><br>
        Shadows that have less defined outlines, are muddy, or overlapping with multiple other shadows will have more varied results and audio quality.

      <div class="q">
        can i get more than one sound from an image?
      </div>

      <div class="a">
        The converter in it's current state is only capable of generating one sound per visual. However, if an image is cropped and has a different outline, this can lead to a differently generated audio track.
      </div>
